Project: foxes-and-rabbits-v2. A project to implement a ocean habitat simulation.

Authors: Michael KÃ¶lling, David J. Barnes, Ivan Arabadzhiev and Adonis Daskalopulos

This project is coursework 3 in Programming Practice and Applications (4CCS1PPA)

Overview: This project is a predator-prey simulation involving many different animal, inhabiting
          the ocean in an enclosed rectangular field. In addition there are plants, corals, dead
          animals, est. The simulation can keep track of several conditions like: day and night,
          temperature and seasons. There are many different implemented interactions between the
          inhabitants and the according habitat and wether conditions.


Attempted tasks:    Base tasks - all attempted (4/4)
                    Challenge tasks - all attempted (3/3)
                    Self-assigned challenge tasks - (6/-)
                    
Self-assigned tasks:    1 - 
                        
                        2 -

                        6 - 
                    

To start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 4000 steps.
